<b>Title </b>: Asymptotic properties and Poisson boundaries of wreath product-like groups <br> <br>
<b>Advisor</b>: Anna Erschler <br> <br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
In this thesis, we investigate combinatorial, geometric, and probabilistic properties of wreath
products and other group extensions. The work is divided into the following two parts.
<br> <br>
1)<i> Non-extendable geodesics in Cayley graphs</i>. We study the property of having unboun-
ded depth in Cayley graphs of wreath products. That is, whether there exist elements at arbitrarily large distance from other elements of larger word length. We prove that for any finite group
A and any finitely generated group B, the wreath product A ≀ B admits a standard generating
set with unbounded depth. If B is abelian, then the above is true for every standard generating
set. This generalizes the case B = Z, due to Cleary and Taback. When B = H ∗ K for two finite
groups H and K, we characterize which standard generators of A ≀ B have unbounded depth in
terms of a geometrical constant related to the Cayley graphs of H and K.
<br> <br>
2)<i> Random walks and Poisson boundaries of groups</i>. First, we study random walks on
the lampshuffler group FSym(H) ⋊ H, where H is a finitely generated group and FSym(H)
is the group of finitary permutations of H. We show that for any step distribution µ with a
finite first moment that induces a transient random walk on H, the permutation coordinate of
the random walk almost surely stabilizes pointwise to a limit function. Our main result states
that for H = Z, the Poisson boundary of the random walk (FSym(Z) ⋊ Z, µ) is equal to the
space of limit functions endowed with the hitting measure. Our result provides new examples of
completely described non-trivial Poisson boundaries of elementary amenable groups.
Next, in collaboration with Joshua Frisch, we completely describe the Poisson boundary of
the wreath product A ≀ B of countable groups A and B, for all probability measures µ with finite
entropy and such that the lamp configurations stabilize almost surely along sample paths. If in
addition the projection of µ to B is Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of (A ≀ B, µ)
coincides with the space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting
measure. This improves earlier results by Lyons-Peres and, in particular, we answer an open
question asked by Kaimanovich and Lyons-Peres for B = Z^d , d ≥ 3, and measures µ with a
finite first moment.
